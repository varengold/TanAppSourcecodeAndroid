        <p>
            This activeTAN app processes your personal data for the purpose of
            protecting your online banking account against unauthorized access exclusively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The processing of data during your use of this app
            is based on a contract or in order to take steps prior to
            entering into a contract in accordance with Article&nbsp;6 (1) (b)
            of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, we inform you about the characteristics of data processing,
            which comes along with usage of this activeTAN app on your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Data processing by this app</h3>
        <p>
            Two groups of personal data are processed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <b>serial number</b>, which identifies the TAN generator and which is assigned
                to the user&apos;s personal online banking account during the process of
                initialization.
                The assignment occurs in the bank system only and not inside the app.
                The serial number is stored on the device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Order details</b>, which are shown during TAN generation, e.&nbsp;g., amount and
                recipient IBAN. The information is transferred via QR code. The details are display
                to approve the order, are used during TAN generation, and eventually are deleted
                from the device.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            During the initialization process, the serial number is exchanged with the bank via
            internet connection. Thus, the bank may assign the user&apos;s personal device to the
            user&apos;s online banking account.
            Any communication uses a secure TLS connection.
            The online banking website&apos;s service provider automatically records information
            about the established connection inside system log files.
            The following data is collected this way:
            the app version, the operating system version, the public IP address of the device,
            and the date and time of access.
        </p>
        <p>
            This data is not stored together with the user&apos;s other personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completion of the initialization process no internet connection is required by
            this app anymore. Order details for TAN computation and approval in online banking are
            recorded and displayed via QR code and the device&apos;s camera. Within the app, such
            data is neither stored permanently nor forwarded to third parties.
